# add-web
ADD-WEB is a Discord server related website and other important scripts related to the project. Some of the files aren't directly related to the website that we are trying to build, but they are the scripts of a discord bot that I made myself. The website should be able to display information from our database that will be sent there by the bot.

## Programming languages
**For the most part we are using python.** The bot was built using discord.py and all the website backend uses flask. The rest of the website is HTML and CSS. Take into account that we have also used different python libraries.

These are the libraries and versions we are using:
```
click==8.0.3
Flask==2.0.2
itsdangerous==2.0.1
Jinja2==3.0.2
MarkupSafe==2.0.1
psycopg2-binary==2.9.1
python-dotenv==0.19.1
Werkzeug==2.0.2
```
You can also find this in the `requirements.txt` file.
(Check the requirements file to get an updated description)

## Where to find everything
We only need help to build the website. You can find all the files inside the `web` folder.

## How to help us
If you want to help us you can download the repository and start writing code. (You will need to install some python libraries to execute some of the main scripts.) If you fix something or implement a new feature create a pull request and we will review it.
**You can't use this project for comercial or personal use.**
