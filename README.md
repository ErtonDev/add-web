ADD-WEB is a Discord server related website and other important scripts related to the project. Some of the files aren't directly related to the website that we are trying to build, but they are the scripts of our discord bot. The website should be able to display information from our database that will be sent there by the bot. We are mainly doing this to learn new skills and we thought that making it public would also be a good idea in case we need any help.

## Programming languages
**For the most part we are using python.** The bot was built using discord.py and all the website backend uses flask. The rest of the website is HTML and CSS. Take into account that we have also used different python libraries.

## Libraries
These are the libraries we are using:
```
click==8.0.3

Jinja2==3.0.2
MarkupSafe==2.0.1

(Check the requirements file to get an updated description in case we forgot to update this one)

## Where to find everything
We only need help to build the website. You can find all the files inside the `web` folder.
**If you have any question, feel free to leave a comment in any active issue and we will answer you.**

## How to help us
If you want to help us you can download the repository and start writing code. (You will need to install some python libraries to execute the main scripts.) If you fix something or implement a new feature create a pull request and we will review it.
**Remember you can't use this project for comercial or personal use.**
